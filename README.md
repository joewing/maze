Maze Generators
==============================================================================
This is a collection of maze generators in variety of programming languages.
Where possible, the same basic maze generation algorithm is used (recursive
backtracking).  Some of the maze generators include a solver as well.  Keep
in mind that I wrote these over a span of several years primarily as a way
to familiarize myself with new programming languages.  For that reason,
some of the code could be improved, which I fully intend to do eventually.

Here is a list of the languages:
 - *maze.4th* Forth
 - *maze.adb* Ada
 - *maze.bas* BASIC
 - *maze.c* C
 - *maze.clj* Clojure
 - *maze.cob* COBOL
 - *maze.cpp* C++
 - *maze.d* D
 - *maze.dylan* Dylan
 - *maze.erl* Erlang
 - *maze.factor* Factor
 - *maze.f90* Fortran
 - *maze.go* Go
 - *maze.hs* Haskell
 - *maze.io* Io
 - *maze.jl* JL (https://github.com/joewing/jl)
 - *maze.lisp* Common Lisp
 - *maze.lua* Lua
 - *maze.ml* OCaml
 - *maze.nim* Nimrod
 - *maze.pas* Pascal
 - *maze.pl* Prolog
 - *maze.pli* PL/1
 - *maze.py* Python
 - *maze.r* R
 - *maze.rb* Ruby
 - *maze.s* x86-64
 - *Maze.scala* Scala
 - *maze.sml* SML
 - *maze.sno* SNOBOL4
 - *maze.st* Smalltalk
 - *maze.tcl* TCL
 - *maze.v* Coq
 - *maze.vim* VIM

Some languages in which I have yet to implement a maze generator include:
 - APL
 - Groovy
 - J
 - Joy
 - Julia
 - Vala

There are, of course, many others.
I prioritize real programming languages over joke programming languages
such as BF, Whitespace, INTERCAL, etc.  There are two reasons for this:
(1) most of the joke programming languages are very primitive, making
the implementation of a maze generator a complex task and (2)
there are many real programming languages available that provide
interesting targets.
